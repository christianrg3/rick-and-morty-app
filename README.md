- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) - Is a very light-weight solution for testing React components. It provides light utility functions on top of react-dom and react-dom/test-utils, in a way that encourages better testing practices.
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) - Is an end to end testing framework. Fast, easy and reliable testing for anything that runs in a browser.
